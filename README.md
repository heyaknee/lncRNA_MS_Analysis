# lncRNA_MS_Analysis
Differential analysis of long non-coding rnas from brain tissue in stagewise multiple sclerosis RNA-Seq Dataset

**Transcriptomic Analysis of lncRNAs in Multiple Sclerosis Brain Tissue**

This repository contains a complete reproducible RNA-Seq pipeline for identifying differentially expressed known and novel long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) across different stages of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) using human brain tissue samples.

 Objectives of my study:
- Identify differentially expressed lncRNAs across MS subtypes
- Detect stage-specific and shared lncRNA signatures
- Discover novel lncRNAs via transcript assembly
- Generate high-quality visualizations such as volcano plots for differntial analysis
- WGCNA

Important Notes Here.
These are the considerations that were taken in my data edit according options and code that fits your data.
NOT ONE SIZE FITS ALL. IS IT SO?

- RNA-Seq data used here is **reverse-stranded**. 
- STAR alignment is performed using **two-pass mode**
- StringTie used for **transcript assembly** and merging
- FeatureCounts run with appropriate strandedness (`-s 2`) (Tip: How to check strandness? 
- Known and novel lncRNAs are both analyzed
- Replicates are summed after checking batch effects
- Metadata and replicate mapping are generated programmatically


## üìä Visual Outputs

Plots are located in the `results/` folder and include:

- PCA for condition separation
- Volcano & MA plots for each MS subtype
- Heatmaps of significant lncRNAs
- Venn diagrams for shared and unique lncRNAs


## üß¨ Novel lncRNA Discovery

- Merged transcript assemblies by biological replicate
- Compared against reference annotations using `gffcompare`
- Novel transcripts with class code `"u"` retained as potential novel lncRNAs
